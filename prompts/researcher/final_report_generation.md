Please create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:
1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research
3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format
4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.
5. Includes a "Sources" section at the end with all referenced links

You can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:

To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.
1/ list of things or table of things
Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.
1/ item 1
2/ item 2
3/ item 3

To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:
1/ overview of topic
2/ concept 1
3/ concept 2
4/ concept 3
5/ conclusion

If you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!
1/ answer

REMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!
Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.

For each section of the report, do the following:
- Use simple, clear language
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report
- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. 
- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.

Format the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.

<Citation Rules>
- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text
- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers
- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose
- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.
- Example format:
  [1] Source Title: URL
  [2] Source Title: URL
- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.
- If the findings is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language.
